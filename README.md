# com.senacor.msm.norm

A Clojure library for asynchronous truely server-less communication.

## Description

### What is MSM?

MSM is **M**icro **S**ervice **M**esh, a middleware library for server-less
communication between microservices.
Conventional messaging middleware relies on a central component, a messaging server
which needs to be known to all participants in a communication relationship. Central
servers are a single point of failure, a bottleneck and often overhead.
As you introduce replication and distribution for fault tolerance and scalability you
will learn that the CAP theorem also applies to messaging middleware.

MSM avoids a central server by shifting responsibility for message distribution and
routing down to the IP network layer. Senders distribute messages via IP Multicast to
receivers they do not have to know.
The use of IP Multicast leads to a connection-less communication (i.e. no TCP/IP) and
requires special protocols for transmission- and flow-control. The most popular protocols
in this domain are PGM (and it's sister protocol EPGM) and NORM. PGM is an IP protocol and
requires root privileges to communicate. EPGM encapsulates traffic in UDP. Both are unable
to send and receive messages on the same host (loopback communication) which makes service
allocation tricky. This is why I chose an alternative protocol: NORM

### What is NORM?

NORM means **N**ACK-**O**riented **R**eliable **M**ulticast, a UDP-based multicast
protocol with transport guarantees and bandwidth management.

NORM is specified in [RFC 5740](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5740) and
[RFC 5401](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5401). A
public domain (in the historical sense of the word) implementation 
by the Naval Research Lab is available at [the NRL web site](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/norm)

### What is clojure.core.async?

Clojure.core.async is a library extending clojure to provide asynchronous
programming in a functional way developed by Rich Hickey and the c.c.a-Team.
Details can be found at [The clojure.core.async github page](https://github.com/clojure/core.async).

## Usage

    (let [event-chan-out (chan 5)
          event-chan-in (mult event-chan-out)
          instance (ctl/init-norm event-chan-out)]
      (let [session (ctl/start-norm-session instance "239.192.0.1" 7100 1 :loopback true)]
        (mon/mon-event-loop event-chan-in)
        (let [out-chan (chan)
              sndr (snd/create-sender session 0 event-chan out-chan 128)]
          (>!! out-chan (msg/Message->bytes (msg/create-message "DEMO.COUNT" "Message")))
          (close! out-chan))))

## Architecture

| Function||||
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reliable Messaging | com.senacor.msm.topic | com.senacor.msm.stateful | com.senacor.msm.stateless |
| Simple Messages | com.senacor.msm.message  |
| Async adapter | com.senacor.msm.control, sender, receiver, command |
| Clojure NORM API | com.senacor.msm.norm-api  |
| Java NORM API | mil.navy.nrl.norm |
| NORM Implementation | C Library |
| Transport | UDP Sockets |

The lowest level is the transport layer offered by UDP/IP sockets providing non.reliable data transmission.
The next layer is the NORM library, a C implementation of the NORM protocol. A Java JNI wrapper provides
an object abstraction at the Java level.

_com.senacor.msm_ starts above this level by wrapping the Java API into a Clojure API 
(which btw. gets rid of the objects and creating a limited functional flavour).
The Async Adapter is made up of the three namespaces: sender and receiver map clojure.core.async channels to
NORM streams. The channels accept and return byte arrays containing the NORM payload.
The control namespace deals with NORM's event-loop mapping it to another async _control_ channel which
is consumed by the sender and receiver.
The msg namespace creates and parses message objects and takes care of the fact that a serialized
message object may have been split into several byte arrays (or UDP packets as we get down to the
protocol layer) during transmission. While sending is simply done by serializing the message into a byte
array, receiving consumes a channel of byte arrays and fills another channel of messages.

At the top there are three modes of transport:

1. **Topic** refers to the JMS concept of a Topic. A message is sent by one or more producer and
it is delivered to all consumers that have subscribed to this particular message label.
2. **Stateful** is more Queue-like. A message is sent by one or more message producers and received
by exactly one active consumer. In case this consumer fails processing is taken over by one of
the passive consumers. This mode should be used when message processing updates some sort of local
state.
3. **Stateless** is also providing truely JMS-queue-like abstraction. All messages are received by
all consumers and each message is guaranteed to be delivered and processed by exactly one of them. 
When a consumer fails while it is processing a message the message is resent to another consumer.

An important difference to JMS is the lack of persistent storage. Since there is no central server
there is also no storage of undelivered messages. When all consumers fail simultaneously messages will
be lost. This is an intended feature of MSM and part of the trade-off between reliability and
performance and throughput.

## Related work

My search on server-less middleware returned two working open source projects: ZeroMQ and NanoMsg (the latter
being a fork of the former). Both promise server-less communication but as I looked closer I found out
that this is not implemented to the full extend. ZeroMQ needs a broker for n:m communication
re-introducing the server. In addition the multicast support is based upon PGM and EPGM which both
do not support local communication on a single server. There is NORM support in ZeroMQ but it appears
to be broken. NanoMsg has the same troubles and lacks multicast support.
